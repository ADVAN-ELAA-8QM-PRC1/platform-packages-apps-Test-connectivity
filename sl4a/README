Scripting Layer For Android

Originally authored by Damon Kohler, Scripting Layer for Android, SL4A, is an automation toolset
for calling Android APIs in a platform-independent manner. It supports both remote automation via
ADB as well as execution of scripts from on-device via a series of lightweight translation layers.

=============================
Build Instructions
=============================

Due to its inclusion in AOSP as a privileged app, building SL4A requires a system build.

For the initial build of Android:

1) cd <android-source-root>
2) source build/envsetup.sh
3) lunch <target>
4) make [-j15]

Then Build SL4A:

1) cd <android-source-root>/packages/apps/Test/connectivity/sl4a
2) mm [-j15]

===========================
Install Instructions
===========================

1) adb install -r <android-source-root>/out/target/product/<target>/data/app/sl4a/sl4a.apk

===========================
Run Instructions
===========================

1) SL4A may be launched from Android as a normal App.

or;

2) To enable RPC access from the command prompt:

    1) adb forward tcp:<HOST_PORT_NUM> tcp:<DEVICE_PORT_NUM>
    2) adb shell "am start -a com.googlecode.android_scripting.action.LAUNCH_SERVER \
               --ei com.googlecode.android_scripting.extra.USE_SERVICE_PORT <DEVICE_PORT_NUM> \
               com.googlecode.android_scripting/.activity.ScriptingLayerServiceLauncher"

    where <HOST_PORT_NUM> and <DEVICE_PORT_NUM> are the tcp ports on the host computer and device.
